It includes the following tools:\n\n**Hardware simulator:** Used to create chips. Features a built-in HDL editor and all the necessary\nservices for simulating and testing chips. Relevant Nand to Tetris projects: 1, 2, 3, 5.\n\n**CPU Emulator:** Emulates the Hack computer (CPU, RAM, ROM, Screen, Keyboard). Allows\nloading the computer with machine language code stored in a file, or entering machine language\ncode directly into the instruction memory. Features a built-in assembler which is invoked\nautomatically if the loaded/entered code is written in the Hack assembly language. Relevant\nprojects: 4, 7, 8, 9.\n\n**Assembler:** Used to translate programs written in the Hack assembly language into code written in\nHack binary code. Relevant projects: 4, 6.\n\n**Bitmap editor:** Used for designing visual elements (like sprites) and generating either the Hack or\nthe Jack code that realizes them in memory. Can be used to help develop computer games and, in\ngeneral, programs that use graphics and animation. Relevant project: 9.\n\n**VM emulator:** Used for two purposes: (i) Experimenting with VM commands and VM code\nsegments, and learning how they are realized on the host RAM, and (ii) Executing compiled Jack\nprograms. Includes a builtin implementation of the Jack OS. Relevant projects: 7, 8, 9, 11, 12\n\n**Jack compiler:** Used for writing Jack programs and translating them into VM code. The latter can\nthen be loaded into, and executed by, the VM emulator. Relevant projects: 9, 12\n\n---\n\n**Team:** This online IDE is an open source, freely available, and ongoing project. The project\u2019s\narchitect is David Souther, and the developers are David Souther and Neta London. The bitmap\neditor was written by Eric Umble. Nand to Tetris, the Hack computer, and related languages were\ndesigned by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken.\n\n**The desktop Nand2Tetris Software Suite:** This venerable working horse, which operated\nfaithfully for many years supporting 250,000+ users on every possible PC/OS configuration, was\ndeveloped by Yaron Ukrainintz, Nir Rozen, and Yannai Gonczarowski. The first bitmap editor was\ndeveloped by Golan Parashi.\n"})})}),c=d}}]);
